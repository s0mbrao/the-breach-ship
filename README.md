Hey user, i will present you this powerful and harmful backend software: this will help you to seek by anything over the world!
With this tool you can find ULP (url, login, password) from everybody. This tool enables you to find leaks in .sql private DBs.

First you will need some things:

1. Download and install Wamp;
2. Download this tool and move to www folder (all resources);
3. Insert your .sql files into db. You will need a db manager for this. (parsed files only)
4. After insert your files, open browser at localhost
5. Seek by anything.

*** Pay attention ***

Large .sql files may can turn the process slow.
I've measured in one of my machines the requisits:


* Intel processor 4 cores+ 3.20ghz + HDD 100Mbps + .sql file w/ 30 GBs ---> 10min++

So if you want this process to be quick, use a SSD NVME 2 PCI 3.0+, it will certainly be more fast,
resulting in seconds your results.
